# AUMS Feedback Automation
The fastest Amrita AUMS feedback completion system, powered by Streamlit and Selenium. Basic yet adequate UI for completing the feedback task in under a minute, which could normally take 20-30 minutes. Thanks to [Soorya](https://github.com/SooryaSRajan) since a lot of the technical difficulties faced could be resolved because of his version of the [project](https://github.com/SooryaSRajan/AUMS-Feedback-Form-Selenium).

Viola! All your pending feedbacks will be filled within seconds infront of you. After operation, go to the opened command prompt window, press Ctrl + C and Select Y to terminate the batch process. You don't need to thank me :)
